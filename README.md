# IWRM2018

This repository contains abstract, submitted article, links to data and code for our paper "Coupling physically based and data-driven models for assessing freshwater inflow into the Small Aral Sea" in the IWRM2018 (http://iwrm2018.bnu.edu.cn/) conference proceedings.

Due to the Github limitation to store large files, you can find all the data and code in our cloud storage on Yandex: https://yadi.sk/d/_0Mp57_P3Poy9z.

Feel free to ask any question creating an issue here, or directly by email.
